## Hi there 👋
I graduated from ISCTE-IUL with a degree in Computer Science and Business Management. Currently,  I am pursuing a Master's degree in Business Analytics. I am also the President of the Association for Computing Machinery (ACM) - ISCTE-IUL ACM Student Chapter.

Here are some topics I am interested in:
🐧 Linux
🔭 Dart
☕ Java
💻 IA

I have always been fascinated by the digital and business realms, particularly the crucial intersection between these two areas. I consider myself to be entrepreneurial, determined, and ambitious, and I am eager to push myself beyond my comfort zone.
At present, I am seeking new academic and professional opportunities that will enhance my personal and professional growth.
I gained experience in the technological world through the completion of individual and collective projects, including websites, applications, games, databases, and other projects, due to my course and participation in an association called the Association for Computing Machinery (ACM) - ISCTE-IUL ACM Student Chapter.
